To serve eyeblasters through an I-Frame, you need to save the attached HTML file (addineyeV2.html) in a sub directory called "eyeblaster" within your site. For example: if the site is www.---.com , the file will be located at: www.---.com/eyeblaster/addineyeV2.html . Please note that this information is Eyeblaster proprietary information and should not be communicated without Eyeblaster’s consent.

If you need further information, this is elaborated on page 10 in the webmasters guide which I have attached.

Let me know if you have any questions,

Thanks!
